Visualization

	Note: Tableau has online videos and how-to's
	
	The picture superiority effect refers to the phenomenon in which pictures and images are more likely to be remembered than words.
	
	A visualization has three goals:
	Discovery, understanding, informed decisions
	Big picture, comparing values, finding patterns
	
	Tableau import:
	Start in cell A1, First line are headers, Each row are consistent and no total at the bottom
	
	Tableau Data Extract or Live?
	Use live connection when TDE is not possible, too slow, too many records/volume, not supporting calculations or complexity. 	http://drawingwithnumbers.artisart.org/tde-or-live-when-to-use-tableau-data-extracts/
	
	Think about the audience:
		what do you need the audience to know/do? 
		How can you present the message?

	A big idea is unique, has stakes (i.e. numbers and somekind of drama), is a complete sentence.
	
	A story is a question + data.
	
	Persuasive presentation:
		big idea/story 
		genuine and authentic emotions 
		the audience is the hero (not you, humility/egoless)
		clear structure (setting, conflict, resolution + short beginning and end)
