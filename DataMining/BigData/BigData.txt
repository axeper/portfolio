Big Data

	3 V: Volume, Variety, Velocity (+ Veracity)
	Definition: any data that is expensive to manage and hard to extract value from.
	

	A database is a collection of data organized to be manipulated efficiently.
	Relational databases were designed with efficiency in mind:
		Everything is a table
		Every row has the same columns
		Relationships are implicit (no pointers)

		Basic operations 
			Selection: select rows from a table 
			Projection: select columns/attributes from a table
			Join: combine rows from two or more tables
				There are four kind of joins: inner, outer, left, right join
	
		A view is a a query with a name.
	
	
	Scalable challenges:
		SOLVED The data doesn't fit in memory
		SOLVED The data fit in k computer
		PROBLEM The data takes too long to go through
	-> Use index
	-> Use parallelization (use hash functions to spread)
	
	MapReduce:
		Split the raw data into small sets
		Map the functions into tidy data e.g (key, value) pairs.
		Shuffle the data into bins (words, f1, f2, ..., fn).
		Reduce the information into (words, ftotal)
		
	Programming model:
		map(in_key, in_value) -> list(out_key, intermediate_value)
		reduce(out_key, list(intermediate_value)) -> list(out_value)
