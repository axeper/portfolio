## Analysis

* From a matrix of relations, create cosine similarity 
* Do some edge pruning with r-neighborhood graph (drop all edges less than x e.g. keep top 20% values), kNN graph: keeps k edges per person.
* Apply modularity maximization: = pruned cosine value - (# connection A * # connection b / total connections)
4) Find the right number of custers through aggolmerative clustering or divisive/hierarchical clustering to maximize the modularity score
