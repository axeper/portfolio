## Analysis

- From a matrix of relations, create cosine similarity 
- Do some edge pruning 
  - r-neighborhood graph (drop all edges less than x e.g. keep top 20% values)
  - kNN graph: keeps k edges per person.
- Apply modularity maximization: = pruned cosine value - (# connection A * # connection B / total connections)
- Find the right number of clusters through agglomerative clustering or divisive/hierarchical clustering to maximize the modularity score
