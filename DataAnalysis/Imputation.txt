## Handling missing data

Strategies :
- Deletion: if the missing values appears to be random, you can drop them. This has no bias effect, but decreases the power of the analysis by decreasing the effective sample size.
- Imputation with the median or mean (bad practice). Note: you can add a new variable, 0 for values and 1 for imputed values to signify that imputed values should not be quite trusted.
- Train a glm to predict missing values
- Multiple imputation: use multiple statistical models to combine multiple regressions.
- KNN imputation
- Gaussian mixture imputation
