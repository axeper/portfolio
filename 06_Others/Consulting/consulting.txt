## Consulting Frameworks

### Profit and loss
- Acquire information about the Economy, Market, Competitors (start with external factors)
- Profits = Revenues - Costs
- WCS: What Constitues Success?
  - What are the major revenues streams? How have they changed over time?
  - What are the major costs (fixed and variables)? How have they changed over time? 
    - Any major shifts? Ask for benchmarking?
  - Look at volumes
  - Products: see advantages and disadvantages


### Enter a new market
- Start with the company
  - Why enter? What are their revenue streams? What is their product mix? What are their costs? WCS?
- State of the current and future market
  - Market size, growth rate, lifecycle (emerging, declining), customers segmentation, technology impact, response from the competition?
- Due dilligence
  - Competitors and their market size? Product differentiation? Pricing? Substitutions? Barriiers to entry/exit? Risks?
- Enter the market
  - Grow organically vs acquire an existing player vs joint venture / strategic alliance

#### Merge and acquisition
- Why?
  - Increase market access, shares, brand; diversify holdings; control competition; inherit talent; obtain patents or license; tax advantages; cost savings
- Research market and competitions  
  - Status of the company, market, competitors, esp. how will the competition respond? 
  - Margins, legal risk, tech risk


### Pricing strategy
- Investigate company
  - Size, market shares, objective, reacting or leading
- Investigate the product
  - How does it compare to the competition? Substitutions, alternatives? Growth cycle? Supply and demand?
- Pricing strategy
  - Competitive analysis: how to price and market the product given the competition and its response?
  - Cost-based pricing: sum of cost to learn the breakeven point
  - Price-based pricing: what are people willing to pay for it?


### Growth and increasing sales
- Increase revenue, volume or both
- What is the company size, resources, products?
- Industry: growth, prices (compared to client and competition)
  - Ideas: expand distribution channels; diversify products or services (! cannibalization); marketing campaigns; acquire a competitor; adjust prices; create a seasonal balance


### Start a new business
- Explore competitors (market share, product differentiation, barriers to entry/exit)
- As an outsider, would you invest in:
  - managment (experience, core competencies, relevant past experiences)
  - market plans (barriers to entry, major players, competitive response)
  - distribution channels (which, how many)
  - products and services (what are we selling, competitive edge, disadvantages, proprietary technology)
  - customers (who, how to reach them, how to keep them)
  - finances (how is it funded, how are the fund allocated)


### Competitive response  
- What is the new product, how does it differ, what changed (costs, techno, customer needs), did they increase or expand channels?
- Response: analyze, rebrand, repackage; introduce a new product; increase marketing; build customer loyalty; cut prices; acquire another player; merge/create a strategic advantage; copy the competition

  
### Turnarounds
- Analyze the cause (bad product, management, economy), are competitors struggling too?
- Review services, finance, products; assure financing; contemplate lay-offs; determine short term and long term goals; visit clients, suppliers and distributors; prioritize and try to get some small success




### Other frameworks
Keep always in mind how the internet, the economy and the competition affects the company.

Company, Costs, Competitions, Client, Channels + Product, Place, Price, Promotion

Porter's five forces: constant rivalry + threat of new entrants + threat of substitutes + bargain power of suppliers + bargain power of buyers

Value chain
- raw materials >>> operations >>> delivery >>> marketing/sales >>> service
- inbound logistics -> production and operations -> outbound logistics -> marketing and sales -> service
  - supporting: human resources, technology, strategy, reearch and development

Cut costs 
- Labor
  - cross-train workers, cut overtime, reduce 401k, 4 10-hours day, convert workers into owners, contemplate lay-offs
- Production
  - invest in technology, reduce inventories, outsource, consolidate suppliers, import parts
- Finance
  - Have customer pay sooner

Growing sales
- raise prices, increase frequency of purchase, target a new customer segment, introduce new products, expand distribution channels, acquire a competitor

Profit = Revenue – Costs = Price/unit * Volume - Volume * (variable + fixed)

Internal vs External + Risks
- Internal: people related to the company, product, process, technology
- External: customers, market, competitors
- Risks

Business analysis:
- Customers: identify the segment, their needs, price sensitivity, distribution preferencess
- Products: advantages, disadvantages; are there substitutions or complementary goods, life cycle, packaging
- Company: capabilities, expertise, distribution channels, cost structure, intangibles (brand), financial situation
- Competitor: competitor concentration, behaviors and strategy; focus on the weakness of a competitor; barriers to entry

Main competitors
- Competitor’s size
- Competitor’s cost structure
- Competitor’s products

The 5 classic dimensions of a how-to-win strategy:
- Product
- Production / Supply Chain
- Channels of distribution
- Brand
- Price

SWOT analysis
- Strength (internal positive); Weaknesses (internal negative); Opportunities (external positive); Threats (external negative)

Economy of scale: cost advantages because of high volume production
Economy of scope: cost advantages because of similar processes (bundling)

## Interview tips
1) Listen, take readable notes, summarize aloud, verify objective, ask questions
2) Structure the case, write it down and go through it with the interviewer
3) State clearly assumptions and quantify qualitative hypothesis and conclusions
4) Conclude and summerize with an action-oriented recommendation closure.

In estimation cases, find a proxy to manever the case.

Use issue tree (be MECE), drill-down analysis, eliminate process, synthesis, recommend action-oriented statements and make it stick
